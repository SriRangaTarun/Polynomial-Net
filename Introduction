This Project's aim is to create a neural network that can figure out the degree of the relationship between any two scalar 
variables (I am referring only to statisitcal or non-deterministic realtionships). This algorithm is aimed at helping the 
researcher or statistician easily figure out the degree of relationship between two scalar continuous random variables w/o
having to guess the degree by looking at a scatterplot. This saves a lot of time and narrows down the search for the best 
polynomial model from all possible polynomials to polynomials of just one degree. After the degree is found out, the reasercher
can simply find the best fitting polynomial model of the given degree using already existing methods.

This network is trying to learn the degree of the relationship, something considered a hyperparameter. This project is intended 
to make this hyperparameter more of a parameter, something that can be learned from the data. It is important to be noted that
this model is not intended to find the "best fitting polynomial degree" (the higher the degree the higher is the maximum level
of fit). It is intended to find the degree of the "underlying polynomial relationship" between the two variables 
(any polynomial relationship with degree greater than 0 can be detected by the model).
